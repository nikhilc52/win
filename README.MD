# "Win" by Nikhil Chinchalkar

This is a story about Winchester "Win" Osgood, a one-of-a-kind athlete. His time at Cornell from 1888 to 1892 landed him in the Cornell Sports Hall of Fame for seven different sports: Football, Wrestling, Men's Track & Field, Men's Rowing, Men's Tennis, Gymnastics, and Boxing.

He also did it all for a girl.
